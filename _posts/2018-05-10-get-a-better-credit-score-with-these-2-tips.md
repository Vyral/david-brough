Most of us would love to improve our credit scores, whether you’re already on the brink of hitting 850 (the highest possible score) or you’re struggling to break into the 700s.

Only one in every 200 people maintains an 850 credit score, but if you follow the two credit-boosting tips we’ve got for you today, you could soon count yourself among them. Even just getting to 750, though, will put you in the good graces of most lenders out there.

Without further ado, here are today’s tips:

**1. Set up automatic payments for all recurring bills.** According to creditcards.com, about 35% of your credit is based upon your payment history. Having your bills paid automatically out of your account each month will save you a lot of time, help you avoid late fees, and build your credit all at the same time.

**2. Pay attention to your credit limit.** Banks don’t look too kindly upon accounts with maxed out lines of credit. It makes you appear less responsible. Instead, experts recommend keeping your credit balance at or below 30%. Surprisingly enough, it’s actually preferable to have between 10% to 20% of your balance remaining, as a zero balance is not ideal. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
