To take a closer look at how to navigate multiple-offer situations when selling a home, I hosted an in-depth discussion about the best ways to handle the process. In this live-chat, you’ll find the answers to important questions that many sellers have.

**For your convenience, I’ve placed timestamps for each topic of discussion that we cover. Feel free to navigate to the section(s) you are most interested in viewing:**

(00:34)—In our current market, are we seeing a lot of multiple-offer situations?

(01:01)—From a buyer’s standpoint, is offering the most money the only way to win?

(04:20)—How important is it to be pre-approved when bidding on a home?

(05:20)—If you’re expecting multiple offers, what should you do before listing?

(06:43)—After receiving some offers, should you decide right away or wait?

(08:07)—Are there ever times you **shouldn’**t take the highest offer?

(10:17)—How to reach me.

I invite you to contact me if you’re looking to buy or sell, have any questions, or would simply like some information. I look forward to hearing from you.
