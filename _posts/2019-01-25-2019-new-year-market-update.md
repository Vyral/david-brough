As we begin 2019, there’s a lot of news coming out of our Fort Wayne market that I’ll discuss with you today in my latest Facebook Live interview.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the full conversation so you can jump ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most:&nbsp;**

0:20—Are we in a buyer’s or seller’s market?&nbsp;<br>1:21—What does inventory look like?<br>2:31—How is inventory affecting home values?&nbsp;<br>3:30—What do interest rates look like?&nbsp;<br>4:54—What do all of the numbers mean for buyers and sellers as a whole?<br>9:29—If you want to sell now, how can you find out your home’s value?&nbsp;

I hope you have a great 2019 no matter what your real estate goals are. If you have any questions for me or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
