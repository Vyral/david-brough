Home sellers want to know what buyers are most drawn to in a home and, as such, are often curious about **the specific rooms to make a priority when getting their property ready for the market.**&nbsp;

There are two rooms, in particular, that buyers will put a premium on as they look for their new home—the first of which is **the kitchen.** That may not come as much of a surprise to you, but the kitchen tends to be a center of activity within the home; time with family is spent in this part of the home, and it’s a primary spot for entertaining guests. It makes sense, then, that buyers want the kitchen to be in top condition and move-in ready.&nbsp;

If you’re planning to sell in a few years or sooner, **concentrate your efforts on replacing the countertops and mismatching appliances.** Getting a set of matching, mid-grade appliances can go a long way—especially since mismatching appliances tends to not go over well with a lot of buyers.

The second room that buyers will take a careful look at is **the master bathroom**, so if yours is looking pass&eacute;, consider doing some updates. If you’re planning to move soon, upgrading the room in its entirety is probably not a wise investment; **give more attention to replacing items like flooring and countertops and less attention to replacing fixtures.**&nbsp;

The garden tub is one bathing fixture that seems to be on its way out in terms of buyer popularity. As a bonus tip, homeowners who plan on staying long-term and who have one of these tubs could replace it with a tiled walk-in shower and really see that investment pay off when it comes time to sell later.
