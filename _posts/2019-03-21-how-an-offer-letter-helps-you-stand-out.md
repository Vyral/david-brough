As we head into the spring selling market, we’re going to see more and more multiple-offer situations occur, so today I’ll share a secret that will help get your offer accepted when competing against more than one buyer.&nbsp;

**One way to stand out is by sending in a buyer offer letter.** It’s a short, one-page document that appeals to the seller from an emotional standpoint. When they receive multiple offers, all they see is numbers and names. Including this letter allows you to stand out from the pack and make a personal connection with the seller. Your offer will include a story about you, your family, and why you love the house so much.

We’ve found great success when producing an offer letter with our buyers’ offers. **I highly encourage you to utilize this strategy if you plan on buying a home in 2019.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions about what our offer letters look like or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
