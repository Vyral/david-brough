Sometimes it pays to go against the crowd. While a lot of people think the spring is the best time to put their home on the market, that’s not necessarily true. In Fort Wayne, September and October are great months for real estate and there are three reasons why:

**1. There’s less competition.** Since a lot of homeowners are waiting for the spring, the fall is a great time for you to get your home on the market and quite possibly be the only one for sale in the neighborhood. Less competition is good for sellers and gives them much more leverage. If a buyer is looking for a home in your area or price range, that puts you in a very strong negotiating position.

**2. Buyers are more serious.** A lot of times, these people have more of a timeline and want to get into a house by the holiday season. This means they will be motivated to get a deal done. There will be fewer buyers total, but the ones out there will be much more serious.

**3. Your listing photos will look fantastic.** While the grass is still green and the leaves are changing colors, getting photos taken for your home's online listing during this time will be your best pictures. Your first showing is online, so you can make it as great as possible.

If you have any questions for me or you’re on the fence about selling this fall, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
